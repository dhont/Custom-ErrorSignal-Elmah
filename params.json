It can be dynamically added to a running ASP.NET web application, or even all ASP.NET web applications on a machine, without any need for re-compilation or re-deployment.\r\n\r\nAbout ErrorSignal\r\n----------------------\r\nIs a flexible API introduce in ELMAH to manually log errors, along with the entire application context (even FORM Data  and server/client variables)\r\n\r\nAbout CustomErrorSignal (available on NuGet as well)\r\n-----------------------------\r\nThis is an alternative to ErrorSignal component. It provides a wrapper for manually logging errors even in console applications or automated tests and returns the ErrorId of the raised exception.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n-------------------\r\nIf the library is added using NuGet in a ASP.NET project, then all you have to do is call:\r\n\r\n\r\n        var errorInfo = CustomErrorSignal.Handle(ex);\r\n  \r\n        var errorInfo = CustomErrorSignal.GetCurrentContext().Raise(ex); // when the application is web only\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nIf NuGet is not used, compile the library (.NET 2.0) and add the library to your project. It depends only on elmah.core to run. When used in a web application, In web.config modifiy the module AND httpmodule ErrorLog to use ElmahExtensions.CustomErrorLogModule, ElmahExtensions.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n    https://code.google.com/p/elmah/source/checkout\r\n\r\n    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/841451/using-elmah-in-a-console-application/1068378#1068378\r\n    \r\n    http://robrich.org/archive/2012/05/02/elmah-return-the-errorid-from-signal-raise.aspx\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
